- Try out SWIG to bind to other languages
- Implement internal ids
- Add phased-property to genome/snp
- Add gchr version no. in genome
- Clean up dna.h in general
- The Python .rs123 attrs should return a function taking a param, so we can
  write genome.rs123("AT") -> True/False. __getitem__ and friends should work
  like they do now (returning the full SNP).
- Use a bloom filter in front of Genome::has to speed up membership tests?
  (benchmark this!)
- Speed up the Python iterator, or create search functions like
  find(chromosome="Y") that are done in C++ (because that's fast!)
- Add move operators to SNPs, etc, benchmark.
