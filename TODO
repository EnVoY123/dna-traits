- Rename struct DNA to Genome
- Merge full-parser branch
- Clean up dna.h in general
- Handle endianness in serializer
- The Python .rs123 attrs should return a function taking a param, so we can
  write genome.rs123("AT") -> True/False. __getitem__ and friends should work
  like they do now (returning the full SNP).
