- Clean up dna.h in general
- The Python .rs123 attrs should return a function taking a param, so we can
  write genome.rs123("AT") -> True/False. __getitem__ and friends should work
  like they do now (returning the full SNP).
- Expose .intersection for Python
- Add equal op in C++ for genome
- Use a bloom filter in front of Genome::has to speed up membership tests
- Google's dense hashmap is unordered, but by using bloom filter above we
  can create an iterator (with some overhead) that can iterate in-order.
- Can now do snp.rs123 == "CT" but:
  - this should also consider the reverse "TC"
  - should be able to write "~CT" as well to compare complement
