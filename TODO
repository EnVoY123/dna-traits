- Add phased-property to genome/snp
- Add gchr version no. in genome
- Clean up dna.h in general
- The Python .rs123 attrs should return a function taking a param, so we can
  write genome.rs123("AT") -> True/False. __getitem__ and friends should work
  like they do now (returning the full SNP).
- Use a bloom filter in front of Genome::has to speed up membership tests
- Google's dense hashmap is unordered, but by using bloom filter above we
  can create an iterator (with some overhead) that can iterate in-order.
