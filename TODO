- Clean up dna.h in general
- Handle endianness in serializer
- The Python .rs123 attrs should return a function taking a param, so we can
  write genome.rs123("AT") -> True/False. __getitem__ and friends should work
  like they do now (returning the full SNP).
- Add .intersection for two genomes (must be done in C++)
- Use a bloom filter in front of Genome::has to speed up membership tests
- Google's dense hashmap is unordered, but by using bloom filter above we
  can create an iterator (with some overhead) that can iterate in-order.
- Add all fields in serializer (ychromo, first, last), i.e. serialize on
  struct Genome.
- Can now do snp.rs123 == "CT" but:
  - this should also consider the reverse "TC"
  - should be able to write "~CT" as well to compare complement
