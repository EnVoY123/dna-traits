dna-traits
==========

dna-traits infers various traits from a human genome by using data available
from SNPedia.

It's very much a personal hobby-project to teach me more about DNA.

Supported file formats
----------------------

Currently only text files from 23andme are supported.

Usage
-----

Build the sources by using `make -j32 dna`, save your 23andme genome as
`genome.txt` and run

    ./dna genome.txt

And you should get some output.
